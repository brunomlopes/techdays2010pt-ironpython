About NLog
----------
NLog is a logging platform for .NET with rich log routing and management 
capabilities. It makes it easy to produce and manage high-quality logs 
for your application regardless of its size or complexity.

NLog can process diagnostic messages emitted from any .NET language, augment
them with contextual information, format them according to your preference 
and send them to one or more targets such as file or database. 

NLog supports .NET, C/C++ and COM interop API so that all your application components 
including legacy modules written in C++/COM can send their messages through a common 
log routing engine.
