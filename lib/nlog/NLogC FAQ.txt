Mini FAQ:

1. Which binaries should I use?
===============================

Make sure to choose the version that matches your compiler and .NET version. 
Make sure to put the NLog.dll in the same directory where NLogC.dll is located.

2. How to compile?
==================

That's simple: just add #include "NLogC.h" and link with "NLogC.lib"

3. Where should I put the config file?
======================================

The reliable way is to put the configuration in "NLog.dll.nlog" file in the same
directory where NLog.dll is located. 

Other options depend on your host application. For example, if are writing 
a ASP.NET application that calls back to C++ code you may also use Web.config
and/org Web.nlog.
